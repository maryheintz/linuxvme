        CONFIGURATION NOTES:

        The esp488.h driver include file contains a number of parameters
        that you can edit to modify permanently the runtime configuration
        of the ESP-488 library.  Some of these parameters and their
        default settings are as follows:

                    GPIB Primary Address         0
                    GPIB Secondary Address       0 (NONE)

                    Board I/O Base Address       0x2000
                    Interrupt Vector Number      0xF0
                    Interrupt Request Line       2
                    Bus Request/Grant Line       3

        The esp488.h file also contains parameters that you can edit to
        modify the operational characteristics of the driver, such as
        whether the driver should use interrupts.

        If you are installing more than one GPIB-1014 interface board,
        or if any of the settings found in the esp488.h file are
        inappropriate for your system, you should change the relevant
        settings before using the MAKE utility to build the driver.

        Also prior to running the MAKE utility, you should edit the
        sys488_master.c file and make any changes needed to implement
        the described OS support functions on your particular system.
        The number of changes required, if any, will vary depending on
        how address conversions are handled on your system, whether you
        have enabled the use of interrupts and/or system timeouts, and
        whether you can link the ESP-488 library directly to your
        application program.

        Refer to the esp488.h and sys488_master.c files for details.

        +---------------------------------------------------------------+
        | NOTE: If your system does not support the MAKE utility, you   |
        |       should use the "pre-parsed" versions of the driver      |
        |       files (esp488.c and sys488.c) for all of your editing   |
        |       and compiling.  For example:                            |
        |                                                               |
        |       edit sys488.c                                           |
        |       cc my_application.c esp488.c -o my_application          |
        +---------------------------------------------------------------+


        INSTALLATION NOTES:

        The default esp488.o module produced by the MAKE utility contains
        all of the function entry points and global variables as shown
        in the pre-parsed esp488.c file.  The optional esp488_X.o modules
        (where X = 1 to 4) provide the same functionality as the esp488.o
        default module, but each contains a unique set of function and
        variable names in the form ibX and dvX.  These modules are for
        use with other GPIB-1014 interface boards installed in the same
        system.

        For example, to install and use two GPIB-1014 boards in the
        system at the same time, you might choose to make and load the
        esp488.o and esp488_2.o modules.  In your application program,
        you should code all function calls directed to the first GPIB
        board using the default "ib" and "dv" naming conventions.
        You should code all function calls directed to the second GPIB
        board to use the entry points in the esp488_2.o module, as
        shown in the following conversion table:

                DEFAULT NAME          NEW NAME FOR 2nd GPIB BOARD

        Similarly, to install four GPIB-1014 boards in the system,
        you could make and load the esp488_1.o, esp488_2.o, esp488_3.o,
        and esp488_4.o modules, and use function call and variable
        references in the form ib1wrt(), ib2wrt(), ib3wrt(), and so on.
