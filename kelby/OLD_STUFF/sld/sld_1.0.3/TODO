The TODO list for the Linux S-Link Driver in reverse chronological order.

4. Speed-up multi-dma
Date: 2000-07-13, v1.0.2, JEG
The project for which this driver was written does not intend to use
multi-dma, so it's currently not in the driver. But multi-dma can be
sped up quite a bit by making a short-cut in hwd_isInterrupt.
If there's only one event causing the interrupt and that is a dma complete,
then it's possible to immediately do handleDmaEnd() and setupDma() there.
This will save the overhead of queueing the bottom half and all the if-
statements in hwd_handleInterrupt. However, the interrupt routine will
take a bit longer (but not too long, I expect).
Anyway this should be a configurable item in the makefile, because if
you usually do not have multi-dma then this will slow things down a bit.



3. Add links in Makefile in sldtest directory for driver files
Date: 2000-07-12, v1.0.2, JEG
To be able to link sldtest, queue.[ch], sld.h and bufuser.h from
the parent directory need to be linked in the sldtest directory.

Fixed: 2000-07-13, v1.0.3, JEG



2. Translate kernel pointers to user pointers
Date: 2000-07-12, v1.0.2, J.E. van Grootheest
This was found using a S-Link LDC that did not completely follow the
S-Link standard. When sldtest is stopped, the LDC does not respond to
URESET and keeps the link up (although UXOFF is on). Then, when sldtest
is started, it opens the driver and the driver immediately starts receiving
data from the S-Link (which is still up). HWD will use putInfo (from BUF)
to queue infoblocks to the user and putInfo will translate the databuffer
pointer from kernel space to userspace. However. Sldtest has not yet mmaped
the driver at that point, so the userspace pointers are all NULL.
The translation must be moved from putInfo to getFullInfoBlock.

Fixed: 2000-07-13, v1.0.3, JEG
The translation was moved from putInfo() to getFullInfoBlock(). This will
slow things down a bit, since there's an extra if-statement in user space,
but usually there's enough idle time in the system. In the kernel it saves
(just) one line.



1. Bigphysarea support
Date: 2000-07-10, J.E. van Grootheest
Adding compile-time support for the bigphysarea patch would make the
driver usable for more project (I expect). Currently the largest
buffersize is 4KB. Using the bigphysarea patch would allow much bigger
buffers. However, it is currently outside the requirements for my
project to add this.
